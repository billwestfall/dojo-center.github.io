homepageIntroduction:
  tagline: People-First Insightful Learning Circles
  pitch: Within peer-supported community circles we learn and practice Metashifts, which are pivotal transformations in mindset, metaphor and motivation.  Wisely applied, they empower individuals, groups and organizations to move away from fear-based approaches towards open, collaborative and courageous engagementsâ€”more akin to sports or dance than combat.  These shifts unleash greater potential for creativity, innovation and collective growth.
